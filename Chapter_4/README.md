# JavaScript 6th Edition Chapter Case 4

Web application that recommends tractor models based on four user selections. Desktop browser compatible.

The tractor selector application accepts user answers to four questions. Each time a user types a character or clicks a box, the program uses a series of decision-making statements to identify the tractor model that best fits the user’s answers, and then adds the name and description of that model to the page’s sidebar. If the user enters inappropriate data (such as text where a number is expected) the program displays an explanation of how to correct the erroneous input.
